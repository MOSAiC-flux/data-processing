# Changelog for major revisions of the tower processing code

## Revision: 0.1, 4/10/2020, M. Gallagher
From the tower to the stations, creating the code foundation. Hard to comment on a few thousand lines of code.

## Revision: 0.2, 6/12/2020 M. Gallagher
A ramshackle path forward but getting there. Code was changed to split data processing into level1 and level2 files, including a preliminary turbulent flux product, according to groupspecificationss. "change_var_name.py" was created to provide a quick/easy way to change output variable names inthe code quickly so that you don't have to manually edit by hand.
